HW2 contains solutions for homework02:
 
- MATH5473HW2: contains all math proved needed
- PhaseTransition.ipynb: is the code for exercise 1 which did simulation experiments on Phase Transition.
- HornParallelAnalysis.ipynb: is MY SOLUTION for exercise 2.
- AdditionHPA.ipynb: is an additional supplement to the above code. In this note only classical outcomes of paran in R are given.

Dataset:
- snp452-data.csv: is the data I used for exercise 2. Since I MODIFIED the original data format. This csv is attached for your reference.
